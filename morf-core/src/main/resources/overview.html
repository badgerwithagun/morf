  <title>Database Support Library</title>
</head>

<body>
Provides interfaces and classes for managing databases and datasets.

<p>Functionality is provided in the following areas:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Database meta data functionality defined by interfaces in the package <a href="com/chpconsulting/database/metadata/package.html">
    com.chpconsulting.database.metadata</a>.</li>
	<li>Database deployment and upgrade functionality is available through <a href="com/chpconsulting/database/jdbc/FullDeployment.html">FullDeployment</a>
    and a class that hasn't been implemented yet.</li>
	<li>Data set functionality is available for streaming data between data bases and file systems in the package in the package 
    <a href="com/chpconsulting/database/dataset/package.html">com.chpconsulting.database.dataset</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Data Set Concepts</h3>
<p>Cryo functionality is divided into the following behavioural categories:</p>

<h4>Producers</h4>
<p>Producers define sources of data. The main producer interface is <a href="com/chpconsulting/cryo/dataset/DataSetProducer.html">DataSetProducer</a>.
Producers allow random access to tables and then provide iterators over the records within those tables.</p>

<h4>Consumers</h4>
<p>Consumers define destinations for data. The main consumer interface is <a href="com/chpconsulting/cryo/dataset/DataSetConsumer.html">DataSetConsumer</a>.
Consumers are modelled on SAX semantics and expect to have data set 'events' pushed onto them.</p>

<h4>Connectors</h4>
<p>Connectors link producers to consumers. The main connector class is <a href="com/chpconsulting/cryo/dataset/DataSetConnector.html">DataSetConnector</a>.
Given a producer and a consumer connectors can transmit all information from one to the other.</p>

<h4>Adapters</h4>
<p>Adapters typically modify a data set in transit either by wrapping a data set producer or by wrapping a data set consumer. They can then be added to 
the chain Producer -> Adapter -> Connector -> Consumer or Producer -> Connector -> Adapter -> Consumer or even both.</p>

<h3>Typical Usage</h3>
<h4>Extracting data from a database to an XML file</h4>
<blockquote><pre><code>DataSetProducer producer = new DatabaseDataSetProducer(connectionResources);
DataSetConsumer consumer = new XmlDataSetConsumer(writer);
new DataSetConnector(producer, consumer).connect();</code></pre></blockquote>

<h4>Inserting data from an XML file to a database</h4>
<blockquote><pre><code>DataSetProducer producer = new XmlDataSetProducer(reader);
DataSetConsumer consumer = new DatabaseDataSetConsumer(connectionResources);
new DataSetConnector(producer, consumer).connect();</code></pre></blockquote>
